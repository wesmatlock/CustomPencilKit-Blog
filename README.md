# CustomPencilKit üé®

> **Ditch Apple's tool picker. Build your own.**

A complete SwiftUI implementation showing how to create a custom drawing interface for PencilKit, because sometimes the default `PKToolPicker` just doesn't cut it.

## The Problem

You're building a drawing app with PencilKit. Apple's `PKToolPicker` works, but:
- It looks like every other PencilKit app
- You can't match your app's design language
- The customization options are basically nil
- You want features that don't exist

## The Solution

Hide the default picker. Build your own. Take control of the experience while keeping PencilKit's excellent drawing engine.

## What This Does

### ‚úÖ Actually Works
- **Custom tool palette** - Your design, your rules
- **Pencil vs Touch detection** - Visual feedback for input mode
- **Simulated brushes** - Highlighter, fountain pen, watercolor effects
- **No gesture conflicts** - Solved the black screen issue
- **State persistence** - Drawings and tools save automatically
- **Zoom without breaking** - Buttons instead of gestures
- **Clean architecture** - SwiftUI + iOS 17's `@Observable`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è PencilKit Limitations (Not Our Fault)
- **No custom textures** - Apple doesn't expose the drawing pipeline
- **No pressure curves** - PencilKit handles this internally
- **No blur/pixelate erasers** - Limited to bitmap and vector
- **No real-time filters** - Would need Metal or Core Graphics

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CustomPencilKit.git
cd CustomPencilKit
open CustomPencilKit.xcodeproj
```

Build and run on your iPad. That's it.

## The Code Structure

```

```

## Key Learnings

### üî• The Gesture Conflict Issue

**DON'T** do this - it causes a black screen when drawing:
```swift
CustomDrawingView()
    .gesture(MagnificationGesture())  // ‚ùå Breaks drawing!
    .gesture(DragGesture())           // ‚ùå This too!
```

**DO** this instead:
```swift
// Use buttons for zoom
Button("-") { scale = max(0.5, scale - 0.25) }
Button("+") { scale = min(3.0, scale + 0.25) }
```

### üé≠ Simulating Advanced Brushes

PencilKit only has pen, pencil, and marker. But we can fake it:

```swift
case .highlighter:
    // Transparent marker = highlighter
    let color = UIColor(color).withAlphaComponent(0.3)
    return PKInkingTool(.marker, color: color, width: width * 3)
    
case .fountain:
    // Thin pen = fountain pen
    return PKInkingTool(.pen, color: UIColor(color), width: width * 0.7)
```

### üì± Detecting Pencil vs Touch

Override `touchesBegan` in a PKCanvasView subclass:

```swift
override func touchesBegan(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with event: UIEvent?) {
    super.touchesBegan(touches, with: event)
    if let touch = touches.first {
        isPencil = touch.type == .pencil
    }
}
```

## Requirements

- **Xcode 15.0+** - For iOS 17 and `@Observable`
- **iOS/iPadOS 17.0+** - Modern SwiftUI features
- **iPad recommended** - Works on iPhone but designed for iPad
- **Apple Pencil** - Optional but recommended for full experience

## Usage

1. **Run the app** - Opens with pen tool selected
2. **Choose tools** - Tap any tool in the palette
3. **Adjust properties** - Color, width, opacity sliders
4. **Zoom** - Use the +/- buttons (not gestures!)
5. **Switch input** - Automatically detects Pencil vs finger

## Customization Ideas

Want to make it yours? Try these:

- **Floating palette** - Make it draggable
- **Radial menu** - Long-press for tool wheel
- **Gesture shortcuts** - Two-finger tap to undo
- **Tool presets** - Save favorite configurations
- **Themes** - Dark mode, color schemes

## Known Issues

1. **Simulator** - Pencil detection always shows "Touch" (no pencil in simulator)
2. **Fountain pen** - Effect is subtle, might need more dramatic values
3. **Performance** - Large canvases may lag with many strokes
